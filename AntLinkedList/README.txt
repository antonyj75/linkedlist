    CONSOLE APPLICATION : AntLinkedList Project Overview
========================================================================

This is the main linked list project.

Below is a description of the files in this project:

AntLinkedList.vcxproj
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

AntLinkedList.vcxproj.filters
    It contains information about the association between the files in the project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

AntLinkedList.cpp
    This source file contains the main function.

AntLinkedList.h
    This header file contains the linked list class definition.
	Microsoft Visual C++ compiler does not seem to allow template class definition to be
	separated out in a source file.
